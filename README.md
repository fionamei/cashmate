## About us!

We are a group of college students studying at Boston University who hope to create an app to help students like ourselves who are dissatisfied with their own spending habits, and struggle to hold themselves accountable for their spendings! 
We learned a lot as we worked on this project from start to finish, and had a lot of fun throughout our journey together. We hope you'll enjoy it too :)
