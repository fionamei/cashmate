## About us!

We are a group of college students studying at Boston University who hope to create an app to help students like ourselves who are dissatisfied with their own spending habits, and struggle to hold themselves accountable for their spendings! 
We learned a lot as we worked on this project from start to finish, and had a lot of fun throughout our journey together. We hope you'll enjoy it too :)

## What we learned
We learned how to create a project from scratch, from giving it a grand vision to breaking down parts of it by user priority, we managed to make a functioning app that looks pretty cool :) Our idea evolved from a simple finance app that would teach users how to budget, to an app that allows users to socialize and bond together! As we created our app, we ran into a lot of technical difficulties, like using tech stacks that were new to us, not knowing how to organize our data, and balancing our own course work on top of meeting in person for sprints. For most of us, we didn't have experience working on a project of this scale, especially since we are mostly sophomores who were not initially set on the CS track. Our frontend team works with our UI/UX developer to bring her beautiful designs to life, and our backend team is the backbone of our project, making functions that create the magic behind what you see. Our budgeting app that is meant to bond others, allowed our team members to bond too! From crashing out on study room couches to eating dominos past midnight, we're really proud of where we are now. Working alongside passionate people is really fun.
